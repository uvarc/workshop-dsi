# Data Science Institute MSDS Bootcamp I - July 2017

## Setup / Prerequisites
* Install the [AWS command-line tools](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your laptop.
* If you have an AWS account already, feel free to retrieve your access key and secret key, and enter them when you run `aws configure` in the command-line tools. We will be using the `us-west-2` region in class.
* If you do not have an AWS account yet, a temporary account will be provided for you.
* If you are a Windows user please install the [PuTTY SSH client](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). (The MSI installer is the easiest way to do this.) Instructions for SSH in Windows can be found [here](workshops/windows-ssh.md).
